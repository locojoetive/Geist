The aim is to make a game, where you enter memories of others.

As a starting point I use __Let's Make Games__ video series (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAM9ZPgEIdeHAsmG50wqL1g).

The aim is to have all libraries inside so you can continue developing from any point in development, if you check out this project, and open it in Visual Studio 2019.
